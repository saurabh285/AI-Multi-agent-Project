# AI Productivity Assistant 🚀

## **Overview**
AI Productivity Assistant is a multi-agent system that automates everyday workflow tasks using AI-powered agents. This project integrates **Large Language Models (LLMs), Google APIs, and Streamlit** to help professionals **manage emails, schedule meetings, and fetch research insights efficiently.**

## **Features**
✅ **AI Email Assistant (Reactive Agent) ✉️** – Summarizes unread emails & suggests smart replies.  
✅ **AI Meeting Scheduler (Proactive Agent) 📅** – Checks Google Calendar & suggests the best meeting slots.  
✅ **AI Research Assistant (Autonomous Agent) 📚** – Fetches & summarizes research papers from arXiv based on user-input topics.  
✅ **AI Workflow Manager (Multi-Agent System) 📊** – Runs all agents & consolidates results into a structured report.  
✅ **Interactive Streamlit UI 🎨** – Users can run agents, input research topics, view results, and download reports seamlessly.

## **Tech Stack**
🔹 **Python** | **Streamlit** | **Google APIs (Gmail, Calendar)** | **Gemini 1.5 Flash** | **arXiv API**  



### **4️⃣ Set Up API Keys**
